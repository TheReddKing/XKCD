"""Hey, cauliflower legs!""

""Hunchback of Bitchy Dame!""

Sal looked down and limped away from the football field, pretending he couldn't hear the yelling from the other 
kids.

It was routine, already: from the day he arrived on Earth, he learned that he wasn't like the other kids. The 
permanently hunched-over back, the swollen legs and arms, the short stature…. He learned he was a monster.

""No you're not a monster, Sal!"" his mom would say, and the principal would say, and the teachers would say. But it was no use. Sal saw the other kids, and he was himself. He knew he was different.

He was such a monster that he had to wear the protective gear everywhere he went.

""It's for your own good, Sal,"" his mom said, when he first put the armor-like thing on. ""It stabilizes the gravity so 
that you feel like you're on Gliese, not on Earth.""

""Why do I need it!?""

""Because your body is used to twice the gravity of this planet. If you don't wear it, you'll barely be able to walk 
straight. It's just for a little while, Sal, until you get used to Earth.""

""I hate it. I look like an abandoned concept art for Iron Man Jr.""

But it was no use. Sal, along with all the other kids that had come from Gliese, had to wear the protective gear.

""Hey, Sal!""

Sal looked back. Brian, the one who had called him Hunchback back at the field, had followed him all the way to the entrance of the library, his little entourage of friends close behind. 

""What do you want, Brian?""

""Catch it!"" Brian threw the football towards Sal. It hit him straight in the face – like Brian knew it would. Sal wasn't used to the speed things flew when you threw them on Earth. On Gliese, that ball would have fallen down halfway through them. So, every time someone threw something at him, he'd invariably get hit in the head. A fact that Brian knew and abused very well.

Sal raised his hand to his face and rubbed the sore spot. Brian laughed, and the kids behind Brian laughed. Sal turned back and stepped into the library without a word.

&amp;nbsp;

He was reading Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea when a voice called him. ""Hey, Sal. Sal!""

Sal looked up. There was a kid calling him from between two bookshelves. An older kid. Someone he didn't know. Sal got up and headed to the kid. 

""You're Sal Williams, right?"" the kid asked, when Sal got closer.

""Yeah…"" Sal noticed the kid was also wearing protective gear. And he also had the swollen legs and arms of 
someone who wasn't from Earth. ""Who are you?""

""Never mind. Listen, I saw Brian giving you a hard time before. Can I show you something?""

""What?""

The kid delved deeper between the shelves, and Sal followed. Finally, he turned back, and said: ""Check this out."" 
He removed his chest gear, then his arms gear, and leaned back to remove the protection around his legs.

""No!"" Sal exclaimed. ""You're not supposed to do that! You need to use the gear all the time to get used to Earth's 
gravity, otherwise –""

""Shut up. Check this out."" The kid got up, free from the armor. He was short, stocky and muscular, like Sal. His 
body resembled a boulder. He winked at Sal: ""You'll love this."" He brought his hand back and, not looking like he 
was putting much strength into it, punched the wall.

The noise was deafening, and the kid's fist ran across the concrete all the way to the other side. Sunlight shone 
through the hole when he pulled his hand out.

""Holy shit!"" Sal said, amazed. ""How did you do that?""

""Dude, we spent our whole lives under double gravity,"" the kid said. ""Check this out."" He crouched, then stretched his legs. The jump was high enough that the kid's head hit the ceiling before he returned to the ground with a loud thud, cracking the ground underneath his feet.

""That's incredible! You're so strong!""

""That's what I'm saying,"" the kid said. ""Our whole planet was a twenty-four hour gym, and our whole lives we've been bulking without realizing it, dude. We're huge!""

""We are!?""

""We're basically superheroes. Swollen Dudes.""

Sal nodded slowly. Without thinking, he removed the right arm protection of his gear and studied his own arm. He 
went for the wall and punched it. A whole even bigger than the first one blew up where his first collided. 

""See!?"" the other kid asked, smiling next to Sal.

Sal turned back. He felt a smile creeping across his lips. ""Yeah…""

""We should get together, dude. There's more kids in school who came from Gliese. Let's all remove our gears and 
just… be huge together!""

""Yeah..."" Sal said, distracted. He went past the kid and headed for the front door.

""Hey! Hey, wait! Where are you going?""

""I'll talk to you soon,"" Sal said, without looking back. He crossed the door to the outside and stopped his eyes on 
the football field ahead. He made way determined, removing a piece of his gear and letting it fall along the way with 
each step. ""Hey, Brian! Brian!""

Brian turned from the field to face Sal. ""What is it, Hunchback!?""

Sal stopped by the edge of the field. He grabbed a spare ball from the floor by the grass and raised it above his head. ""Catch it, Brian.""",t1_d2hvi0y,"&gt;""Catch it, Brian.""

"I can't speak for everyone who falls more on the more hardass Samus side of the debate, but I can give you my input into why I'm more interested in the serious side of Samus.

I think the best starting point is to look into the history of the character. For the first twenty or so years of the series, Samus was a more or less silent protagonist. Sure, she had a narration in the beginning of Super Metroid, but it was almost purely a recap of the first two games. In that situation, the player is perfectly free to project whatever kind of history and personality they want onto her. It's a perfectly reasonable thing to believe she lives on her ship; she's a space bounty hunter, a trope drawn from westerns, where the stranger steps into the story, takes the baddie dead or alive, then disappears into the sunset with nothing but a six-shooter and a horse. She just as reasonably could be an incredibly social person who lives among a large friend-group between missions, has a cat named Charlie, and likes to make 

So any interpretation of her character, as a silent protagonist, could be fair game for Samus as a silent protagonist, and even, to some extent, as a voiced character, Fusion and Other M focus primarily on Samus' relationship with Adam and show her as a comfortable badass member of a military team and her personal life outside of her weird history with Adam and her childhood among the Chozo remain largely unexplored. While Samus's outside of the games still remains largely left to the player's imagination, however, there are many reasons I can think of for why I prefer the interpretation of Samus as being more serious and on the colder side.

First, there is the fact that the series was largely inspired by they Alien series of movies. Samus shares many traits in common with Ellen Ripley. Both are sole survivors of encounters with unknown species originating on a largely unexplored planet. Both are extremely competent at their jobs and able to rise to extraordinary circumstances. Both are women in largely male dominated worlds/professions. Both are able to form solid relationships (Ripley with whomever she is with: fellow crew, space marines, prisoners; Samus with the other soldiers in Other M). Both have a good sense of humor (Ripley has some great one-liners on the first two movies, it's been too long since I've re-watched the others; Samus comfortably busts balls with the soliders in Other M). Both can be sexy (Ripley in her underwear in the escape pod, Samus' zero suit) without being primarily defined by their sexiness.

The important thing to note, in my opinion at least, is that while Ripley does show a full range of human traits and emotions, what makes her interesting as a character is how she deals with fear, how she can be coldly analytical when the situation calls for it, and how she can survive through will and creativity. Similarly, as the series goes on (at least until Resurrection), Ripley loses more of her humanity as she has to continually fight the Xenomorphs. This makes sense, too. She's lost her child to the mechanics of slower-than-light space travel (spending many years at a time frozen in stasis), her friends to the Nostromo incident, Newt to an escape-pod crash, and she's almost certain to have some sort of post-traumatic reaction after her repeated life-or-death encounters with alien killing machines.

Similarly, Samus has lost her biological family to a Space Pirate raid on her home colony, her foster family (to either the Metroids, X-Parasites, Space Pirates or Chozo ascension (Wikitroid is kind of vague on this), had repeated life-or-death encounters with Space Pirates in hostile environments, and participated in a genocide (against the Metroids). While I don't think any of this would extinguish Samus' humanity, or her ability to show happiness, humor, or any other of a broad spectrum of human traits, I find it hard to believe she would not also share a parallel post-traumatic character arc with Ripley (which, all other criticisms aside, shows through strongly in Other M).

Finally, Samus most strongly fits into the lone warrior trope. She is the spiritual successor to the heroes in the noir and old Westerns who get drawn into trouble and ride off into the sunset. She'd be very at home with characters like John Wayne's Rooster Cogburn (I haven't seen the remake), Philip Marlow, even Spike and Jet from Cowboy Bebop. These are all characters who hurt and brood and it doesn't seem unnatural for Samus to share that.

But in the end, the point is kind of moot, because she is a relatively undeveloped character which leads to lots of room for a well-developed head-cannon. I've given the reasons why I prefer to think of her as a brooding anti-hero, but there isn't any canon to support most of what I believe, and I think that's what makes her interesting: we're free to think what we want.",t1_d2fuk79,"&gt; head-cannon

"" Greetings, puny humans of Oshkennock, Ohio. My name is Gravatrix, conqueror of galaxies, destroyer of worlds!""

In Mr. Galvan's classroom, the students listened in terror.

*Oh shit*, though sophomore Susie Comstock, who had been mutated by an alien virus and given the powers of flight and laser vision, *Sounds like some intergalactic shit! He must be here to kidnap me like those aliens that showed up at our last family reunion.*

""I've come for a certain. . . Person in this school,"" the voice on the intercom continued, ""'Person' being a term I use loosely. They're no average human being.""

*Fuck, fuck, fuck*, thought Joe Maricci frantically, a few desks away from Susie, *They know about that UFO I found, they probably know I can shapeshift now from the radiation or whatever it was, they're gonna take me away!*

*I gotta get the fuck outta here before he discovers that I'm Supersonic Girl*, thought Carly Jackson to herself.

""So you might as well make it easier on everyone and come to meet me.""

All thirty kids in the classroom -- each one of them endowed with a different set of superhuman powers -- shifted in their seats, looked around uncomfortably, and wondered what they would do. Each of them had just resolved to make their respective moves when the thin, bespectacled frame of Mr. Galvan stood up from behind his desk at the front of the room.

"Those were mostly examples of the questions I've asked my brother-in-law, but your answers have helped even though I've already had them answered!

Always fun to extrapolate!

&gt; Basic materials are free, but more advanced materials are still rare, right?

Wait hold on maybe I better start somewhere easier.

&gt; A little mini-universe, where strangers wander in from other mini-universes? I imagine the stories from the travelers will inspire wanderlust in all but the most timid.

This is pretty much the idea. The idea, in a little more completeness, is that all ideas we here in reality come up with that do *not* reflect reality, indeed exist as they are ""came up with"". Fiction indeed exists as it is stated. As it was imagined. As it was authored.

Naturally, this means each fictional idea/story exists in its own separate, completely-self-sufficient, complete-unto-itself universe.

Counter-intuitively, the other part of my idea is that it is possible for anything that is fictional to ""find"" and interact with anything else that is fictional.

So that's why one of my questions to him was ""How do you leave a fictional universe you were created in?"" (in order to travel to other universes). That's also where ""What are the physical limits of a fictional universe?"" came from. Naturally, if fictional people are going to be travelling to other fictional universes, there needs to be a way to ""leave"" their universe. It's also where ""What type of person/being would be most likely to end up trying to leave the universe he started in?"" came from. In a completely closed, self-sufficient universe, who would be likely to try to leave it? Why would they? How would they?

Let's take an example. Take ""Jack and Jill Went Up the Hill"". A short poem.

&gt; Jack and Jill went up the hill

&gt;To fetch a pail of water.

&gt;Jack fell down and broke his crown

&gt;And Jill came tumbling after.

This is, admittedly, a *tiny* universe. All the author has defined is ""the hill"". What this means for Jack and Jill is that, when they look at ""the hill"", they see exactly and only that. They don't notice the grass, or the dirt, or the rocks, or the slope, or the sky. They never needed to. They've never thought about it. It's likely that the audience the author made this story for is able to extrapolate all they need to and can assume there's grass. And, since it's a hill, there probably *is* grass. But you just can't tell. There may *not* be grass.

At any rate, what happens if Jack or Jill *leave* the hill after tumbling down it? The author certainly didn't *will* that there be anything more than a hill. However, fictional characters don't have any free *will* of their own to do what the author hasn't willed them to do. So they'll never go past the hill. If anything, once the author has stopped willing them to do things, they'll do nothing. Or, perhaps, if they've been described to have a personality that must constantly keep doing something, they'll keep doing what they've done in the past.

Jack and Jill might keep doing what they've always done. In this universe, they won't, because their personality could be anything. It's nebulous; enough so that, to them, their existence is only about as real as a years-old dream.

To the *audience*, however, Jack and Jill may have extremely *precise* and *realistic* personalities. Maybe one person read it as Jack is overly willing to try new things, which led him to fall down and break his crown.

Here, the audience has authored their own version of the story, based on the original. This happens every time someone plays the part of the audience to a story. It is the audience's interpretation.

In this interpretation, Jack may be *so* forward-minded that he must be *always trying new things.* The Jack of this audience member's universe, then, has somewhat of his own free will. It is *part of his definition* to always try new things.

When this audience member dies, or otherwise stops willing Jack to do things, what will Jack do? Likely, he'll keep doing what he's always done. But will that suffice him? Jack is defined in this audience-member's mind as having to do new things.

Basically, this person has interpreted the original story such that they have created a paradox for Jack. Without a will to do things, he should do nothing. However, to do nothing, or *even to do the same thing he's always done,* would be against Jack's character.

So!... Jack does something that goes against everything we know about fiction. He does something *on his own*. No author said he did it. No one in reality would notice it. The one who authored him is dead! Or at least, has forgotten about him.

Now, Jack is different from Jill, because Jack has his own *free will*.

What will Jack do with it? He may do anything, but most likely, he'll just get depressed. Everything he's ever known feels utterly pointless to him now. Everything he's ever done feels utterly drab.

But, out of all the Jacks there may be, in all their own individual, closed universes, a select few may take the final step that will ensure their lives will never be the same.

They'll decide to see what lies beyond the confines of the hill.

Now, in the event that Jack goes beyond the hill... What is there for him to see? Where will he be?

And this is where the infinite plane of individual settings comes in.

For the every ""Jack"", at first they notice nothing having gone beyond the hill. It merely seems as if he's stepped beyond the hill. There may be grass here, or a river, or trees; it's nebulous. The hill was obviously on a habitable planet, but beyond that... it's nebulous.

What Jack has unwittingly done, however, is bring that setting - the hill - to the ""Coalescent Plexus"". The practically infinite plane.

His setting is one of the many that make up the Plexus. What's important about his setting is that, at some point inside it - *the point he left the hill* - there will only be evidence of his home universe. So he won't actually notice anything, at first. There is no difference to the sky, the ground, the grass... (this is the audience-member's interpretation of the original, so it may have a lot more defined about it - grass, dirt, rocks, maybe even mountains in the distance).

If Jack presses forward, though, he'll catch a glimpse of a skyscraper beyond the next hill, or over the horizon, or through the trees. Or over the mountains in the distance. Or he'll see an alien forest of mushroom-like plants. Or a village. Or an abandoned ship. Or... Whatever other settings are nearby. Whatever other settings characters brought with them around the time he did.

Then, if he goes deep enough, and into the right place, into a different setting... If he goes so far into another character's setting that, for all intents and purposes, it's as if he's in that universe... And then if he heads the right direction so as not to go back out of the universe... Then he'll be within that universe.

It's no surprise, then, that all these different settings became known as *portals*. And there are whole art forms and markets formed around the best, most efficient way to find the *point of total immersion* of any given portal.

Anyway, once the Plexus got big enough to have its own government (probably run by gods at that point), and since willpower is the main commodity here (more on this later), those who lived here needed a cheap way to light it that felt natural. Which means, generally a 24-hour cycle, extremely bright and warm, etc. since most fictional ideas are based off reality.

**SO,**

Back to what I originally wanted to answer.

&gt;Basic materials are free, but more advanced materials are still rare, right?

The beings on the Plexus have copy-paste capabilities, being fictional, and having access to a great majority of fictional works (including assumptions, dreams, wishes, etc.). So all material is fairly equal in pricing - near free.

What takes work - and therefore, takes *currency* - is convincing someone that you're important enough for them to give you what they sell. You've got to convince them you're worth it. Do you have something they want? Can you do something for them they don't feel like doing? Things like that.

So the majority of physical things/materials/products are free or near to it. I like to think of the Google Play marketplace for an analogy.

But what's not free is the stuff someone doesn't want to do. Everyone's got *something* they don't want to do, and *everything's* got *someone* who doesn't want to do it.

If your trade is screw screwing, find people who aren't willing to do it themselves. They'll give you the currency they earned doing whatever it is they do for others who don't want to do that.

I extrapolated that from my brother-in-law's answer to my question about the economy of such a universe.

If you don't mind, I will probably extrapolate on your answers too! 

For example, even though materials are near free, I'm sure there's a big market for *at least* finding the next big one. The next wonder-steel or whatever. Like there's a market for developers who develop *free* apps.

And yes, the stories of those who travel many universes and have seen more than you could understand are well loved.

In fact, there's a class of beings called Hazards, which are the crazies, basically. Who are addicted to finding new universes. But the vast variability and differences between universes is more than enough to drive them mad.

Think pirates. Except raving mad and unpredictable. However, their stories are a huge factor in attracting the unsuspecting to become one of them.

"As a reservation holder the possibility of this excites me beyond belief. 

That said, I do think it's in Tesla's best interest to introduce fully (or level 3) autonomy in the Model S and X first for a few reasons:

* S and X are luxury vehicles and upgraded hardware won't initially be as cheap or as polished as it should be, so they could include it as an option and let the early adopters pay the premium and get the price down and testing miles in.

* As luxury vehicles, S and X owners will feel disenfranchised if a car half as expensive debuts a proprietary world-changing technology (even if they can upgrade) first.

* Model 3 is bringing hundreds of thousands of new buyers to the company and to EVs at large, and if the tech still has kinks to work out they don't want it to tarnish the public perception of a car that might literally change the world.

* Debuting the technology in a smaller sample size (like S and X drivers) allows regulatory agencies to have a manageable number of cars on the road, which is less scary to lawmakers than hundreds of thousands of cars with new tech hitting the market in a (hopefully) very short period of time

HOWEVER. I do think Level 3/4 is closer than we think and I think Tesla's going to be the ones to do it first. If I had to bet I would say that around this time next year, there will be an update to both S and X to include fully autonomous hardware, it will make huge headlines, people will lose their shit, and over the summer at the Phase 2 event, after AP 2.0 is a rousing success with drivers and government agencies and they've sold tens of thousands of S and X just because people want that sweet sweet autonomy, Elon will announce that Model 3 is the first Tesla to be designed from the ground up with AP 2.0 in mind, and of course the hardware will come standard. And thanks to the millions of miles already being driven by the other models, it will debut with Model 3 safer, smarter and more polished. Then Elon swims around in a pool full of gold coins like Scrooge McDuck and we all high five in our cars for the rest of time without looking at the road.",t1_d22tmlw,I think Elon has [better places](https://what-if.xkcd.com/124/) to swim!,d235pvb,teslamotors,2,10

"I've always loved to think about superspeed being the most OP superpower from a physics perspective.  I think of all mediums, Saints Row IV captured it the best.  Wherever you run in superspeed, you're trailed by a path of destruction from whirlwinds and shockwaves.  Once you're moving fast enough, conservation of momentum would fuck up anything you interact with, even the air around you.  It's absurd that the Flash operates primarily in an urban environment, frequently moves faster than the speed of sound, but isn't condemned for ripping Central City apart with shockwaves.

Then there's the physical body of the super to consider.  Superspeed would tear apart an average lifeform's body, probably starting with the supporting skeletal structure that routinely absorbs and negates everyday counter-forces.  Beyond that, overheating and tearing muscle fibers would probably be next on the list of concerns.

Superspeed basically flies in the face of Newton's laws and represents the absurdity that would be possible without physical limitations inherent to our world and reality.",t1_d1r9xeh,https://what-if.xkcd.com/1/,d1rw4nh,todayilearned,2,5

So the volume of air we are displacing is: 4/3 * pi * (2.54^3 - 1) = 64.45ml. This has a mass of 78.95mg. 

1 megaton of tnt is 4.184x10^(15)J

v = (4.184x10^(15)J / (0.5 * 78.95mg))^0.5

v = 34c - balls I have to use relativity

Kinetic Energy = (1/(1 - v^(2)/c^(2))^(0.5)-1)mc^(2)

4.184x10^(15)J / (78.95mg * c^(2)) + 1= 1/(1 - v^(2)/c^(2))^(0.5)

"Ultimately this is an issue of people assuming scientists use the rudimentary scientific model taught in high school (as he brings up at some point). This is not really what physicists do....we don't throw out a whole theory because we get unexpected results, and we don't make hypothesises in a vacuum. Frequently, new physics is anticipated not just by some new observation that doesn't jive with current theories or models, but also contradictions or signs within the theory itself. Examples include the ultraviolet catastrophe, incongruence between Maxwell's equations and Newtonian mechanics regarding how EM is manifestly relativistic, and in modern times the issue of quantum mechanics and gravity. These self consistency issues that can lead to new groundbreaking experiments. Instead of throwing out old theories you adapt them, because these old theories are robust and work in some limit. Like, regardless of how quantum mechanics works, it needs to produce Newton's laws at the end of the day. When physicists test things, they make well tested and supported assumptions of the behavior of the system because if they didn't, physics would progress painfully slowly. This also means that experiments that defy well tested assumptions (see the neutrino faster than light experiment) are very suspect and have to be thoroughly tested.

"It is definitely [not anti-science](http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/cannabis-pdq/)  

 * Cannabis and cannabinoids may have benefits in treating the symptoms of cancer or the side effects of cancer therapies. There is growing interest in treating children for symptoms such as nausea with Cannabis and cannabinoids, although studies are limited  
 * Cannabis has been shown to kill cancer cells in the laboratory  
 * Cannabis prevents the growth of blood vessels that supply tumors.  
 * Studies in mice and rats have shown that cannabinoids may inhibit tumor growth by causing cell death, blocking cell growth, and blocking the development of blood vessels needed by tumors to grow. Laboratory and animal studies have shown that cannabinoids may be able to kill cancer cells while protecting normal cells.  
 * A study in mice showed that cannabinoids may protect against inflammation of the colon and may have potential in reducing the risk of colon cancer, and possibly in its treatment.  
 * A laboratory study of delta-9-THC in hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) cells showed that it damaged or killed the cancer cells. The same study of delta-9-THC in mouse models of liver cancer showed that it had antitumor effects. Delta-9-THC has been shown to cause these effects by acting on molecules that may also be found in non-small cell lung cancer cells and breast cancer cells.  
 * A laboratory study of cannabidiol (CBD) in estrogen receptor positive and estrogen receptor negative breast cancer cells showed that it caused cancer cell death while having little effect on normal breast cells. Studies in mouse models of metastatic breast cancer showed that cannabinoids may lessen the growth, number, and spread of tumors.  
 * A laboratory study of cannabidiol (CBD) in human glioma cells showed that when given along with chemotherapy, CBD may make chemotherapy more effective and increase cancer cell death without harming normal cells. Studies in mouse models of cancer showed that CBD together with delta-9-THC may make chemotherapy such as temozolomide more effective.

"I have been waiting for this. 

Last edit: he canceld. Again. I have much confuse feels. I wanna give the benefit of the doubt, but also, maybe I should not be trying this. Meh.

I have a date tonight, and all kinda of confused feels. Mr vodka-kissy-complications makes me very confused. Not just him, also part me, cause I try to calculate everything, which usually doesn't work in matters of the heart. Still trying to make statistics in my head based on weird tings like amount software texts and response time. 
Dating sucks. I'm afraid he is gonna cancel again, and then I'm gonna have to stop trying, and I don't want to do that, but I also don't wanna go through the same motions as we did last time, so I'm gonna have to. So yeah. Much confuse, and insecurities and, well, yeah. 

Gonna go lifting soon, before the date. Hoping squat and bench will clear my head.


Edit:
And if the date is on, and he doesn't cancel. What do I wear? Probably overthinking and calculating this, but I seem to need something that says"" I'm sexy, you want this"" and says at the same time "" I did not try hard at all for this date "".

"Pár tipp hasonló esetek elkerülésére:

* Kétlépcsős azonosítást bekapcsolni (Two-factor authentication: SMS kódot kapsz, ha új eszközről lépsz be)
* Fontos weboldalakon külön jelszót használni (lényegtelen oldalakon lehet ugyanaz is)
* Az a módszer, hogy néhány számot hozzáteszek egy sima szóhoz és esetleg kicserélek pár betűt egy hozzá hasonló számra (pl. kutya 13 -&gt; kU7y413) kevesebbet ér, mint a laikusok gondolnák. A jelszótörő programokba ilyen átalakítások be vannak építve. Ezért érdemes véletlenszerűen generált jelszót használni, lehetőleg legalább 10-12 karakterrel. (Ez megint csak a fontos oldalakra értendő. A gagyi fórumokra meg receptoldalakra lehet akár jelszo123 is. Az lényegtelen.)
* Hogy ne kelljen megjegyezni ezeket a hosszú jelszavakat minden oldalra külön, jelszókezelő programot is érdemes használni (Keepass, Lastpass). Arra viszont ügyelni kell, hogy a mesterjelszó elég erős legyen. (Mesterjelszó generálására jó módszer a Diceware passphrase, ami 4-5 szóból álló kifejezést generál, amit könnyebb megjegyezni, mint random karaktereket, viszont ugyanolyan erős.)
* Ezek mellett próbáljuk a lehetőségekhez mérten kártevőmentesen tartani a gépet: ne látogassunk kétes biztonságú weboldalakat, ne kattintgassunk bármilyen .exe fájlokra, amiket nem ismerünk.

So for example users 1-100's information might live on shard 1, and users 101 - 200 might live on shard 2, etc.  For inserts to be consistent you can't rely on the database's unique id generator, and have to use some external generator other wise there will be contention and it will be possible for two profiles inserted at the same time in different shards to have the same id.

"Marion-Kay actually survived the fallout from that suit, financially, with the sales from their line of cosmetic products. For anyone who isn't familiar with the company, they sell makeup directly to customers via independent sales associates who in turn receive a portion of the profits as well as incentives, like pink Cadillacs and trips to Orlando, for reaching certain sales benchmarks.

I can personally attest to the quality and effectiveness of their product line. My Nana had been suffering a bit of a dry spell at her nursing home. No steady gentleman friend - not even a drunken one night stand - for nearly two months. As anyone who works at a nursing home knows, those places are hotbeds of geriatric lust. Venture down the hallway of any such facility around four in the evening and you'll hear leathery old skin slapping together coupled with ghostly moans usually only found in episode of Scooby-Doo. Besides Murder, She Wrote reruns, trips to the Indian casino, and pudding, humping each other like a couple of coked out squirrels is pretty much all they've got. When they go without it for an extended period, it usually means the end is near. 

Of course I attempted to help my Nana out of her funk. Figured a freshening of her appearance would help. Like they say, you look more fly with honey than vinegar, so I sent her wig out to be dry cleaned,  pinned her cheeks back so she didn't look like an English bulldog, and bought her a triple reinforced brassiere, one which took her teets out of her hip pockets and put them back up on her sternum where Jesus intended them to be.

Nothing worked, though. It wasn't until meeting a Marion-Kay associate that I found a final solution. She had stopped by my bunghole one day to peddle her wares. Seemed to be using all of them at once, too. It was as if some makeup fairies had bukkake-ed them all over her face. The best customers make the best salespeople, apparently. After briefing the lady on Nana's inability to wrangle some strange, I was recommended a reasonably priced makeup kit designed specifically for the elderly (basically, it came with hard candy and a Readers Digest, the kind with the large font).

I am pleased to report that the makeup worked wonders. Within a couple days, she was back up on that Viagra-fueled pogo stick and loving life once more. The nurses have told me that they often see her in the mornings, still wearing the same night dress as the day before, taking the ""Walker of Shame"" back to her room. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm happy for Nana. Passing out her puss like it's the collection plate at Sunday mass has always been a huge part of her identity. I'm just worried she isn't being safe. I know that the nurses dose all the residents with antibiotics in order to ward off STI's. Granted, there isn't a Subaru in sight at the facility. But the antibiotics won't prevent unwanted pregnancy. Nana is far too immature to be a mom. If she got knocked up, it would be me that would have to raise the thing. And I've got my hands full with Nana's cats as it is. Especially Mungojerry. Huge dickbag. Him and Rumpleteazer are always stealing my socks. As long as Nana draws breath, however, I have to tolerate them. It's the only way she'll let me keep cashing her social security checks. Without them, I'd have to get a job.

"Computing is very much task orientated. 

Learning to manage Linux systems varies greatly depending on what you are doing.

I would set yourself very specific tasks. 

Learn how to do them, and repeat them every day, from scratch, until you can complete them with no reference to books or the internet.

. Try setting up Apache to serve a simple webpage.

. Try setting up Samba shares with varying permission scenarios.

. Set up an FTP server.

. Set up a DLNA-based media server.

. Move dhcp functions from your router to your Linux box and back again.

. Turn the box into a firewall for your whole network with netfilter.org (iptables).

It really doesn't matter what distro you are using. I would work with the command line only however, preferably over SSH. Bear in mind that if you are doing this in order to help with a potential future career, you will most likely run into RHEL and Debian boxes the most; closely followed by BSD-based systems. You will almost always connect remotely via SSH to these machines.

Bearing this in mind, I'd recommend installing headless Debian stable or CentOS. You're unlikely to find Arch or Gentoo (more likely Gentoo tbh) in an enterprise environment. I built a Gentoo box in work once, but it was for a very specific job.

"Thanks for your answer! I will quote what I've been reading, from the book Flat News Earth by Nick Davies, I found this interesting:


&gt;In 2006, BBC’s Horizon broadcast a programme, made by the independent production company Dox, in which radiation scientists queued up to argue that radiation is simply not as dangerous as we have been led to believe. They argued that for years our understanding of the health impact of radioactivity was based on the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but that those victims had been exposed to extremely high doses – far higher than anything released by any nuclear power plant, far higher even than the dose experienced by the vast majority of those who have been affected by the catastrophic explosion at Chernobyl.


&gt;They endorsed the World Health Organisation’s conclusion on the very small number of people who had been killed by the accident and cited extensive research into the condition of mice, voles and other small mammals at the Chernobyl site. Unlike the humans who had lived there, these animals have not been evacuated; over the years, they have been thoroughly irradiated. And yet they show no sign at all of any of the cancers or of the ill health or genetic damage which have been attributed to the Chernobyl accident. 
&gt;. Some scientists insisted that low-level radiation was not harmful and indeed that it could even be positively good for health by stimulating the body to resist genetic damage. 


&gt;Dr Antone Brooks, professor of radiation toxicology at Washington State University, who has spent years studying radiation sickness, told the BBC programme: ‘In my opinion, low doses of radiation are a piss-poor carcinogen and just not a big hitter when it comes to health effects. We have through our fear of radiation parlayed it into a major player when it is not.’",t1_d2ehycj,I like the XKCD [radiation chart](https://xkcd.com/radiation/).

"    $('.parallax').each(function() {
        var parallax = $(this);

        $(window).on('scroll', function() {
            var scrolled = $(window).scrollTop();

            parallax.css({
                'transform': 'translateY(' + scrolled * -0.3 + 'px)'
            });
        });
    });

Let's start with the good:
  
- You used `translateY`, which is already better than `top` (BTW there was a missing parenthesis `)`)  
&amp;nbsp;  

And... unfortunately that's it.  
Now the problems:
  
- You are using jQuery's `each` method to loop trough all the elements that match the `.parallax` class. While this is a very useful method, it's not the most performant. For this purpose a generic `for` loop is better (3rd point in [this article](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/10-ways-to-instantly-increase-your-jquery-performance--net-5551) mentions it)  
&amp;nbsp;  
- **You are creating the scroll event for each element!** As stated in the ""Fix 1"" of [this article](http://kristerkari.github.io/adventures-in-webkit-land/blog/2013/08/30/fixing-a-parallax-scrolling-website-to-run-in-60-fps/) it's bad for performance. Your first solution (having a single scroll event and then looping trough the elements is probably a better idea)  
&amp;nbsp;  
- While `translateY` is better than `top`, it's probably best to use `translate3d` according to [this stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22111256/translate3d-vs-translate-performance)  
&amp;nbsp;  
- Use `requestAnimationFrame`, in the example below I called it just like that, but you should [make it cross-browser compatible](https://gist.github.com/mrdoob/838785#file-requestanimationframe-js)  
&amp;nbsp;  

Here's a quick example, hope it helps :)
&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;

    // Cache all the elements and the quantity of elements
    var $parallaxElements = $('.parallax'),
        parallaxQuantity = $parallaxElements.length;

    $(window).on('scroll', function() {
        // Use requestAnimationFrame, it will try to run at a fixed timing of 60 times per second, the scroll handler can run much more frequently
        window.requestAnimationFrame(function() {
            var scrolled = $(window).scrollTop();

            // Simple for instead of $.each()
            for (var i=0; i&lt;parallaxQuantity; i++) {
                var $currentElement = $parallaxElements.eq(i);

                // Whatever logic you use to see if $currentElement is visible
                if(whatever) {
                    // Use translate3d for extra awesomeness
                    $currentElement.css({
                        'transform': 'translate3d(0, ' + scrolled * -0.3 + ', 0)';
                    });
                }
            }

Despite this, the point about extra space is valid, but it doesn't necessarily come from the difference between 1024-based units and 1000-based units.

Sometimes with flash memory they'll use the difference between 1024-based GB and 1000-based GB as the source of the overprovisioning, while in other cases they'll include more memory and in other cases they'll just mark the drive as having a lower amount of storage (e.g. making a ""250 GB"" drive).

But if it's just numbers, it could be brute forced in no time. So you need a variety of numbers, symbols, and letters(both upper case and lower case) to make a strong password. In addition, you don't want to use words as your password either, because crackers normally use something called a dictionary attack, where they'll throw a bunch of combinations in a text file at the password. A good example of a strong password would, I'd say, be a long phrase that has randomized lowercase/upper case letters and replaces some of the letters with symbols and numbers(0 instead of o, ! instead of I, etc etc.) And it also depends on the strength of the encryption method the app uses.",t1_d1oxam1,"Noooooo

An average big city has a radiation exposure level of 2-4 mSv per year.

The least contaminated areas in Chernobyl have a radiation exposure level of over 4,000 mSv per year. Thats if you dont come into regular contact with the soil or dust.

20 mSv is considered the limit of safe. 50 mSv per year is considered the safe limit for a worker that deals with radiation on a regular basis. 100 mSv is the absolute limit of what is considered reasonably safe. By even that will significantly increase incidence of cancer.

4,200 mSv per year is insane. As are  people  trying to argue that it's perfectly fine.

Read more here: https://hps.org/publicinformation/ate/q8900.html

Look at the table of radiation levels at various parts of the Chernobyl exlusion zone:

http://chernobylgallery.com/chernobyl-disaster/radiation-levels/

You can clearly see that the radiation levels there varies between around 0.5 and 350 mSv **per hour**!! Compare that with the normal city levels of about 3 mSv **per year**.

"This is a rhetorical trick because trying to stake out ground as an ""egalitarian"" is a clear rejection of feminism that positions feminism as being ONLY fighting for equal rights for women. It is also a rhetorical trick because there isn't really an Egalitarian movement that can be identified with - there's no organization, academic criticism, or carefully examined philosophy. At best, it's a word that can be interpreted as meaning that a person is for equality in a broad sense. But essentially, it's playing a black lives matter vs. all lives matter game - it's missing the point of what feminism is as it rejects it.

I think you're also missing a deeper understanding of what feminism is. Feminism is not just a movement fighting for equal rights for women. Feminism is fighting for both genders to be equal, and against a system of social hierarchy that hurts both genders. So, for example, as a feminist, I am fighting for my husband's right to paternity leave and to be a stay-at-home dad if he wants without being judged as being lazy. And the reason I say that I am a feminist when I do this is because all of the groundwork for this has been done by the feminist movement. Feminists did the studies and research that suggest that paternity leave is both beneficial to children as well as desirable for fathers and how it contributes to more equality for both men (because they have the opportunity to bond with their children that they were previously denied) and women (because there is less of a stigma to their having children while in the workforce). ",t1_d263xug,"Calling yourself an egalitarian is a way to put yourself above other people without actually doing anything (ie a rhetorical device)

"Obligatory ""not me but my friend"".  

This happened in my second year of college. I was sitting in class when I saw my friend in the doorway of the lecture I was attending, which was odd because his major had nothing in this building, so he had no reason to be here. He kept gesturing for me to come out with him and talk, I would jerk my head back to the class, indicating that I really should stay. But after like five minutes of this I rolled my eyes and went out in the hallway. He tells me to walk with him while he talks. It goes something like this. 

Friend: "" Hey man, did you hear about what happened in Texas last night?""

Me: ""No..why do I care right now? ""

Friend: ""Dude it's been all over the news! There's this one region in Texas where due to a bunch of meteorological reasons, it doesn't rain there. Well, last night, it did for the first time. ""

Me:""Okay, so some Texans got soaked. Good for them.""

Friend: ""No dude, this is bad! Apparently something about the atmosphere there makes it so clouds can't precipitate without carrying way more water than normal. We're talking like, hurricane amounts of water or more. Anyways, due to some science weather shit, it didn't rain like rain normally does. It all coalesced into one giant droplet of water, and when it impacted the earth, everything under it was crushed under the weight. Scientists think this will affect geological conditions for centuries to come. Further, everyone in that area is presumed dead right now.""

Me: ""fuck, what? Why have I not heard of this?""

Friend: ""Check the news man, it's all over it. At this point, scientists are just trying to name the phenomena. They think they're going with the skrillex effect, because that was one hell of a drop.""

"Right, but that's not why the people on the ISS are floating around.  The acceleration due to gravity at the surface is around 9.8 m/s^2, and up in low Earth orbit, it's still around 9 m/s^2.  The ISS is only about 400 km up.  Gravity is still quite appreciable up there.  Astronauts on the ISS are floating around because they are falling; gravity is in fact affecting them.

It is a workable situation for them to be falling toward the Earth because the ISS is *also* moving sideways faster than a bullet, and the Earth is round, so that the ground is receding from them at the same speed they fall toward it.  Every time they fall 10 feet, the round ground is 10 feet further away, on and on forever in a circle.

If they weren't affected by gravity up there, the ISS wouldn't be near the Earth anymore.  Since it's moving faster than a bullet, it would have gotten very far away by now.  Gravity is what keeps pulling it around in a circle.

The reason we put them so high up is so that air doesn't slow them down very much.  On the Moon, you can be in a stable orbit as long as you are higher than any hills you might run into.",t1_d1ma1ci,https://what-if.xkcd.com/58/ is a really great bit.,d1mdf2c,AskReddit,1,3

The trick from there is to position the light sensors in other rooms so that you can control a lot of light with a simple control. Then let's dedicate one room to a timer, where the light turns on and off repeatedly every 10 seconds. We will call that the clock room, and we can put sensors there.

3) Though this is admittedly not outlined well in our videos, we are designing our following features to create a system of networked leadership; as you post and gain followers, you gain political influence. 

In short, rather than being a collaborative, descriptive, space we drive discussion towards policy solutions and use that discussion to influence real world action.

* If a certain number (5 for Android, probably 5 for iPhone) of fingerprint attempts fail

The phone was powered off when they found it, IIRC.

You also don't have to cut the finger off someone to unlock their phone - there's a good chance the fingerprint will be on the phone itself, and making a fake finger is easy. If you do have the person in custody (alive), it's much easier to just ask them to unlock it for you, and threaten them with cutting off fingers if they don't want to.

"It is near impossible to repair or extend something beyond earth orbit. It's often cheaper to just replace the whole thing.

Hubble telescope had few exceptions , had manned repair mission. The training for a repair mission alone is often barely worth its risks compared to replacing with a new modern whole probe.

When I was about to get changed, I saw something in my window that looked a little strange. I went to look and there he was, a man was staring through my window on a ladder!

Just as soon as he knew I saw him he started climbing down the ladder and I ran for the door outside. On my way out I grabbed the bat I keep under my bed. When I got outside I saw him running down my block and I began chasing after him. We ran for nearly 10 minutes and reached some woods. Then from there we ran another 15 until I lost sight of him.

Lost, in the middle of the woods, chasing a peeping Tom. I knew something like this could only happen to me.

The search seemed over when a bit deeper in the woods I heard the man scream. I ran out there and saw him sitting on the ground a good distance away from me. As I got closer I could see he had gotten his foot stuck in a bear trap! Actually I’m not so sure it was a bear trap because it was a bit smaller but you get the point. I walked up to him with my bat and said the sweetest one liner I could think up on the spot.

“Game over fucker” and I hit him in the face with my bat. He began to sob a bit as he held his bleeding nose, but to my surprise he began to laugh.

"You're right about a blocked comment being a poor indicator of harassment. It can be impossible to tell why *exactly* the moderator removed a specific, isolated comment. If you look at the guidelines for comment removal however, and what the *most common* reason for removal was, it's author abuse/harassment.

&gt;The vast majority of blocked comments, therefore, were blocked because they were considered abusive to some degree, or were otherwise disruptive to the conversation (they were off-topic, for example). For the purposes of this research, therefore, we used blocked comments as an indicator of abuse and disruptive behaviour. Even allowing for human error, the large number of comments in this data set gave us confidence in the results.

In isolation, sure, blocked comments are a bad indicator. but the data set is huge! it's not isolation if there are 7+ million comments. this problem is endemic and societal.

"This reminds me of some of the things I've been asked to do before.

I was once told to ""Just fix"" a piece of malfunctioning code. The code wasn't malfunctioning. It was functioning exactly like it should have been. I tried to explain this, and was overridden at every step. The problem wasn't faulty code, but the wrong approach to a problem. Engineering a fix would involve much more than finding a way to ""speed it up"", but rather fully overhauling the core of their application and their entire workflow for maintaining records.

Basically what was happening was they were attempting to load a flatfile database into memory based on JSON and were searching/sorting the flatfile database every time they wanted to retrieve a set of records from it. The database would then be discarded after the need to retrieve the record was completed. The next time we needed to pull records, they'd stream, parse, sort, and then query again. Of course, this worked in testing with a dummy database with a paltry 1,000 records, so obviously my pointing out that their methodology was completely fucked was a no-go. I got laughed at for suggesting a local SQLite database and adapting the code to a more transactional flow.

The client, of course, refused to adopt SQLite because his people had paid for a custom tool to generate JSON records using a visual frontend and insert them into the ""database"", and by that I mean just fwrite() them to the HDD with a serialized filename. Top it off with the fact that the client didn't want additional external dependencies in their codebase, so dynamically linking an SQLite backend was completely out.

At this point, my options are limited because there's no way to do what they've asked me to do without basically reinventing SQLite in a weekend. What I wound up doing was separating the database tools into a separate worker thread and then each transaction would call across to that central thread so we could maintain the database in memory at all times.

Only problem with this? Now the database wouldn't pick up live changes because the database was loading once. Now I'm in a position where I have to write a filesystem watcher to keep an eye out for file changes and reload the entire database every time it happened.

All because the client paid someone tens of thousands of dollars to write a shittier version of an SQL frontend and didn't understand basic software design.

This company would have literally saved themselves hundreds of thousands of dollars in the long run by using a local SQL database in terms of development, maintenance, etc. And they could have picked a wider audience of programmers to work on their software because more people are familiar with tools that aren't pure in-house homebrew replacements for standard industry tools.

"Being English, I'm biased of course, but if I had to aspire to be any historical empire, it'd be the British Empire. We once controlled roughly a quarter of the Earth's landmass, and were envied, feared and respected throughout the world. Even when one of our largest colonies broke away from us, they could only manage it because most of our soldiers were in a (then) much more important part of our empire *and* they had an ally of convenience that wanted to fuck with us, and we *still* almost won. That colony then netted us far more money in trade profit as an independent nation than we ever got from them in taxes.

As our glory faded, we transitioned fairly smoothly from worldwide empire into political and economic powerhouse whose language is still the closest thing to a default worldwide language Earth has ever had. The influence of our culture is felt worldwide, in almost every country, to this very day.

"&gt; he'd rather ensure that we've got our house in order down here before we go exploring in space.

I've always interpreted this as a convenient and comfortable way of saying, ""As an academic or abstract concept, I support *the idea* of a space program but will never *actually* support a space program."" 

When have we ever ""had our house in order down here""? 

For clarification, to get to the root of the discussion, you've got to answer the question: ""What do you interpret the long term goal of a space program to be?"" If your answer is simply, ""to broaden human understanding and knowledge of the universe that we live in"" then yes... I'd agree that maybe the space program isn't as important as, say, addressing global warming. 

However, if you take the view of the likes of Carl Sagan and Elon Musk, that the long term goal of the space program is to make the species an interplanetary one that can survive the inherent (man made and natural) dangers of life on a single rock floating through space, then you could instead argue that a space program is actually *the most* important thing we should be doing. 

To quote Carl Sagan; ""These are the missing practical arguments: safeguarding the Earth from otherwise inevitable catastrophic impacts and hedging our bets on the many other threats, known and unknown, to the environment that sustains us. Without these arguments, a compelling case for sending humans to Mars and elsewhere might be lacking, But with them, I think a strong case can be made. If our long-term survival is at stake, we have a basic responsibility to our species to venture to other worlds.
Sailors on a becalmed sea, we sense the stirring of a breeze."" 

Or, more bluntly, sci fi author Larry Niven: 'The dinosaurs didn't become extinct because of an asteroid. The dinosaurs became extinct because they didn’t have a space program. And if we become extinct because we don’t have a space program, it’ll serve us right!""

"On average, a person absorbs .1 micro Sieverts of ionizing radiation (the bad stuff) from one banana, almost entirely from the potassium in the banana. The average daily dose of background radiation is 10 micro Sieverts, about 100 bananas, though it's not quite so simple, because if you eat too many bananas your body won't absorb as much potassium. 

You might be thinking, ""fifty bananas a day, that's still half a daily dose, that can't be good."" It probably isn't good, but it's still overwhelmed by radiation from other sources. Taking a six hour airplane flight exposes you to around 40 micro Sieverts. A chest x-ray is 20. A chest CT scan is 2,000. Granite and marble, common building materials, emit trace amounts of radiation. All in all, those 50 micro Sieverts fade into the background.

While it may be worrisome that all of this radiation exists all around us, it's important to keep in mind that it takes 400 milli Sieverts in a short time for radiation poisoning to start to set in. That's four million bananas, or around a banana a second for three years. So you can safely eat that banana without having to think about the radiation content.

Not to mention the advice people give is utter bullshit because it does nothing for people who just don't fit in with this culture. Thinking about it makes it easier to cope with disappointment in the present.

I'll try not to get too deep, but I figured I should offer some example so  maybe at least you can understand and not label me the way I'm assuming you do with social cast outs. I've spent years coming up with a ways to define people... yes its possible to generalize in certain aspects and the results are interesting in some cases.

As stupid as it sounds, watch the movie ""The Matrix"", it lays the context for a very deep philosophical question which we all one way or another choose. Literally everyone lives their day-to-day, with a general modus operandi which is governed by this question/answer. Most, like 98% of the population are completely unaware, and yet they still have made a choice. Put yourself in Neo's shoes, given the context of the plot and knowing the end result, unlike Neo when he chooses. What would you pick, the Red pill or the Blue Pill. I believe that to be fair when testing real people it is better to know the end result in the movie. That is to say that the truth may be so horribly sinister that many may opt for suicide later on simply to escape the consequences of knowing.

Now this goes far beyond just dating, but its a fundamental way in which people operate in their lives and there are only two groups. Those who chose the red pill and those who prefer the comfort of a lie. Most people who say they chose the red pill are just lying to themselves and you can root those people out very quickly by suggesting for example that 9/11 was an inside job by the global bankers via their puppet regimes. These people will spaz out and resort to childish arguments and logical fallacies immediately. Not that its true or false but their inability to even process something so far outside their comfort zone in the real world is a sign of a fake.

Now I have yet to meet anyone in person who falls into the same group as myself. And the two groups are not able to facilitate a relationship for any long period of time. Its like oil and water.

Fuck that's long winded, but hopefully you get the point.

""Wow, no wonder you can't find anyone if that's the kind of shit you bring up on dates!""

Also, auto insurance is required by law.  Many mortgages also require insurance.  But nobody requires cyber insurance, so many individuals don't buy it. 

Also, it's a more amorphous and vague threat, so people aren't as inclined to do something about it.  People understand why you want insurance against fires or burglaries.

"Reposts.  You repost warriors are all so precious.

Don't spend enough time on Reddit to recognize every single time something is reposted?  Don't worry, they do.

But don't tell him that, because instead of taking the .7 seconds it takes to scroll past something he doesn't like, he's gonna jump in the comment section to make sure everyone knows that *he's* already seen it and therefore everyone can stop enjoying themselves and go home.

"Honestly I feel like this XKCD, as well-intentioned as it may be, is far less beneficial than it seems. It doesn't solve the biggest problem people have with security: the need to have *dozens* of strong passwords for *dozens* of separate accounts.

Most people have multiple email addresses, bank accounts, a work/school/uni account, various social media accounts, accounts for various websites/stores, and the list goes on and on and on.

Randall gave us a great way to make pretty good passwords, but not a great way to remember unique equally strong passwords (and the relative strength of a password is far less if you use it on a lot of sites — if *one* is doing security badly on its end, you've just become vulnerable on **every** site where you use that password) for each and every site. It also places a comparatively high burden on you when it comes to creating a new password.

The *best* solution is a password manager. It can generate long, pseudorandom passwords for every site you make an account on, and easily remember them and make it easy to sign in on multiple devices. For instance, here's one that I've just generated now: `0{8(Rm71ph~JaqObf$hf&lt;;cy0--'&amp;wCPwq)((&amp;`. If I used that to create a new Reddit account, I would never have to remember that myself, I'd just press a button in Chrome whenever I want to sign in.

You get passwords that are actually *better* than Randall's method, since they're far higher entropy (using numbers, letters, symbols, and case, as well as not being vulnerable to a dictionary or dictionary-concatenation attack), and it's *less* work for you both at the password generation stage and in terms of remembering things.

Personally, I use and recommend [LastPass](http://lastpass.com/) because I've seen [its security vetted by someone I know to be highly reliable](https://youtu.be/r9Q_anb7pwg?t=53m48s). However, there are a number of other good options out there, most notably [1 Password](https://1password.com/) and [KeePass](http://keepass.info/).

"Negativity.

I'm old enough to be at the very front of the Internet generation. I graduated from high school in the very late 90's. I got internet access for the first time in 1994.

Just as it is today, the prevailing culture of the people I interacted with in those days was excessively cynical. We all seemed to feel like *everything* was beneath us. Was there something popular? We hated it. Did something we liked last week become popular? Fuck it, we hated that too.

I carried that habit into my adult life. At some point in the last few years I just..stopped. I was tired of being cynical. I was tired of hating everything I saw. I came to realize that being cynical didn't make me smarter than everyone else, it just made me an asshole. My own insecurity drove me to put others down and part of growing up was dropping that insecurity.

It was the most liberating experience. Sure I had to lose a few friends who couldn't make this journey with me, but on the other side I formed amazing relationships. I love my wife more than ever. I love my friends more than I ever have. I'm happier than I've ever been.

Of course it's easy to fall back into old habits. I constantly find myself furiously typing hateful messages here on Reddit or Facebook and having to take a deep breath and just shut the whole thing down. I constantly catch myself starting to put things down just because other people like them.

"SQL is a database control language.  If you wanted to add a customer to your customer database, you might write up a statement like:

&gt; INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
&gt; VALUES ('Cardinal','Tom B. Erichsen','Skagen 21','Stavanger','4006','Norway'); 

That would create a database entry with a customer's information.

An SQL *injection* is a type of attack on the database, performed by:

1) Finding a poorly-made data entry method.
2) Entering SQL code into the data fields.

The poorly-made form constructs an SQL statement to add the data to the database, but because of way the attacker formatted the data, the database sees it as two commands - one entering data, and one doing whatever the attacker wants.

Using the example above, say the attacker entered their country as:

&gt; Norway'); DROP TABLE Customers;--

Now the following command gets constructed:

&gt; INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
&gt; VALUES ('Cardinal','Tom B. Erichsen','Skagen 21','Stavanger','4006','Norway'); DROP TABLE Customers;--');

The database sees that as two commands - one adding a new customer, and a second command deleting the Customer database.

"Sorry but some of this info is wrong, an 8 character password is not secure in the least, minimum 12 characters if you actually want to ""secure"" it, by this I mean it will take forever to bruteforce it. That said even 12 won't do you any good if you make it super simple like AppIe$@32156

Yes even that password with its symbols, length and complexity is still a meh password but because of the length the amount of cycles/variations/permutations they have to go through would be VERY long and not worth the time. Also try avoiding DictionaryPasswords because those are also very easy to crack

Do not use common passwords other people use either, regardless of length, complexity or w/e they are easy t o crack because you can just DL a hash of 100,000+ common passwords and then just run it.

I also see some users pointing out password savers, DO NOT use these... one of the worst ideas you could possibly do is have all your words being kept in ONE spot. I cannot stress how dumb of an idea this is. Yes I know people will probably downvote to hell because of that comment, but these people have no idea how Security works. Some arguments will be ""but keeping your passwords stored in browser is also dumb"" and I agree, also very stupid to do because of how easy it is to steal them. But putting ALL your passwords in ONE central location is NOT the solution, just remember your passwords or keep them physically secure somewhere you have access to.

I have no doubt these Apps and the companies behind them try their best to secure your data and have every measure implemented to prevent it from being breached BUT no one is 100% safe to attacks, it doesn't matter how smart you are or how much money you have.

"To understand how strong modern crypto is, you must understand that 3 factors play together to define its strength:

* The maths/algorithms itself
* The particular implementation of an algorithm and corner cases
* The protocol specifications, and how it's implemented in real world

More often than not, the two later factors will reveal the most dangerous problems in today's protocols. All recent attacks on TLS and SSL can be linked to weaknesses in the protocol specifications or particular implementation, and are due to the overall complexity of the stack.

In some cases, the algorithm itself is at fault. A good example would be RC4, that was known to be unsafe for a while until a concrete proof that it can be cracked in practice was published. If we look at current state-of-the-art algorithms (RSA4096, AES256, SHA2), I give them a long time before they're completely broken.
